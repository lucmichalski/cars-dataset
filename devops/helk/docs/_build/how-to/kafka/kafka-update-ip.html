<p>For the docker deployment, you will have to update the environment variable ADVERTISED_LISTENER first. You can do this in your system hosting the entire HELK or the Kafka broker itself if your distributed your docker containers across other systems.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span><span class="nb">export</span> <span class="nv">ADVERTISED_LISTENER</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="m">10</span>.0.10.104
</pre></div>
<p>Then, you can simply just run docker-compose the same way how it was used to build the HELK. This will re-create the system with the new value assigned to the environment variable <code>ADVERTISED_LISTENER</code>.</p>
<div class="highlight"><pre><span></span>sudo -E docker-compose -f helk-kibana-notebook-analysis-basic.yml up -d
</pre></div>
<p>If you just restart your containers, it will not update the environment variable in the Kafka broker. You have to re-create the container. Not re-creating the broker would still show you messages like the ones below:</p>
