<p>If you believe logs are not being sent to HELK from winlogbeat then there are a couple of things that could be going on. For this document we will stick to looking at only winlogbeat itself. If your logs contain what is shown below then winlogbeat is shipping/sending the logs properly and therefore could be an issue somewhere else and thus you should consult the wiki for additional resources.</p>
<h2 id="Installed-as-a-Service">Installed as a Service<a class="anchor-link" href="#Installed-as-a-Service"> </a></h2><p>If winlogbeat is installed as a service then the logs will be located within:</p>

<pre><code>%PROGRAMDATA%\winlogbeat\logs\winlogbeat</code></pre>
<h2 id="Manually-Running-the-Executable">Manually Running the Executable<a class="anchor-link" href="#Manually-Running-the-Executable"> </a></h2><p>If you are manually running winlogbeat then the logs will be within the directory you are running winlogbeat.exe at the path</p>

<pre><code>.\logs\winlogbeat</code></pre>
<h2 id="Viewing-Logs">Viewing Logs<a class="anchor-link" href="#Viewing-Logs"> </a></h2><p>To view the logs you can simply use notepad or notepad++ or use a powershell command such as</p>

<h2 id="Log-Output">Log Output<a class="anchor-link" href="#Log-Output"> </a></h2><p>Your logs should contain information with the verbiage successfully published #NUMBER events, similar to the output shown below</p>
